                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected and used when you visit my link-in-bio page, which serves as a directory of links to my fitness tools and other content.

                <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>Please be aware that <strong>I do not directly collect any personal information from you</strong> when you visit this link-in-bio page. The only data collected is through the use of third-party services, specifically Google Analytics and Google Search Console, which automatically gather certain information about your visit.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> This web analytics service provided by Google tracks and reports website traffic. It may collect information such as your IP address (which is often anonymized), browser type, operating system, referring website, the pages you visit on this link-in-bio page, the date and time of your visit, and other anonymous usage data. This information is used to help me understand how users interact with my page. You can learn more about Google Analytics’ data practices in their privacy policy available here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Google Search Console:</strong> This service by Google helps me monitor and maintain my site's presence in Google Search results. While it doesn't directly collect user-identifiable information from visitors, it provides aggregated data about my page's performance in search, such as search queries that led to my page, click-through rates, and any technical issues. This data helps me improve the discoverability of my content. Google’s main privacy policy also covers the data handled by Search Console, available here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>. Additional terms for Search Console can be found here: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://search.google.com/search-console/term/additional" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search Console Additional Terms</a>.</li>

                <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
