            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected and used when you visit my link-in-bio page, which serves as a directory of links to my fitness tools and other content. This page is operated by Kurt Astarita ("I," "me," or "my"). Your privacy is important to me, and this policy is designed to provide transparency about the limited data collection that occurs on this page through third-party services.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>Please be aware that <strong>I do not directly collect any personal information from you</strong> when you visit this link-in-bio page. The only data collected is through the use of third-party services, specifically Google Analytics and Google Search Console, which automatically gather certain information about your visit.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> This web analytics service provided by Google tracks and reports website traffic. It may collect information such as your IP address (which is often anonymized), browser type, operating system, referring website, the pages you visit on this link-in-bio page, the date and time of your visit, and other anonymous usage data. This information is used to help me understand how users interact with my page. You can learn more about Google Analytics’ data practices in their privacy policy available here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Search Console:</strong> This service by Google helps me monitor and maintain my site's presence in Google Search results. While it doesn't directly collect user-identifiable information from visitors, it provides aggregated data about my page's performance in search, such as search queries that led to my page, click-through rates, and any technical issues. This data helps me improve the discoverability of my content. Google’s main privacy policy also covers the data handled by Search Console, available here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>. Additional terms for Search Console can be found here: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://search.google.com/search-console/term/additional" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search Console Additional Terms</a>.</li>

            <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
            <p>The information collected by Google Analytics and Google Search Console is used for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Website Analytics:</strong> To analyze trends in website traffic, understand how users navigate my link-in-bio page, and identify popular links. This helps me improve the content and user experience of this page.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Monitoring:</strong> To monitor the technical performance of the page and identify any errors or issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO):</strong> To understand how my link-in-bio page is performing in Google Search, which helps me optimize the page for better visibility.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>I do not access or use the data collected by Google Analytics and Google Search Console to personally identify individual users.</strong> The data is aggregated and anonymized, providing insights into the overall usage of my page.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
            <p><strong>I do not share any personal information with third parties</strong> because I do not directly collect any. The data collected by Google Analytics and Google Search Console is managed by Google according to their own privacy policies and terms.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>I do not directly control the data retention policies of Google Analytics and Google Search Console. Please refer to Google's privacy policies for information on how long they retain the data they collect.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Since I do not directly collect your personal information on this link-in-bio page, many of the standard data privacy rights (such as the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data) are primarily applicable to the data collected by Google. I encourage you to review Google's privacy policy to understand your rights regarding the data they collect through Google Analytics and Google Search Console.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Security</h2>
            <p>I take reasonable measures to ensure the security of my link-in-bio page itself. However, the security of the data collected by Google is governed by Google's security practices, which you can find in their privacy policy.</p>

            <h2>8. Links to Other Websites</h2>
            <p>This link-in-bio page contains links to other websites, including my fitness tools and other content. Please be aware that these external websites have their own privacy policies, and I am not responsible for their data handling practices.
